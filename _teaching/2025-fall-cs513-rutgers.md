This is a graduate-level course on the design and analysis of algorithms. We will explore fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for computationally challenging problems. The course will cover classic paradigms as well as modern algorithmic techniques. The goal is to provide students with a robust theoretical foundation and an understanding of the mathematical tools needed to tackle complex algorithmic problems in their own research.

This course expects students with undergraduate algorithm knowledge. If you plan to take this course, I expect that you know what the following words mean: Big-O notion, Time/Space Complexity, Run-time analysis, Asynmpotic Upper and Lower bounds.

## Grading:
Homeworks, Midterm, and Final.
<!-- Roughly 6-7 written homework (30%), midterm (35%) and final (35%).
- You may discuss problems with your classmates, but you must write up your solutions independently
- All homework must be written in LaTeX and submitted as compiled PDF files
- No late homework will be accepted
- The lowest homework score will be dropped from the final grade calculation -->
- Both midterm and final exams are closed book. The final exam is cumulative. You are allowed to bring a handwritten letter-size "cheat sheet".
