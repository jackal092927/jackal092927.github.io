This is a graduate-level course on the design and analysis of algorithms, intended for PhD students. We will explore fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for computationally challenging problems. The course will cover classic paradigms as well as modern algorithmic techniques motivated by applications in large-scale data analysis, graph theory, and machine learning. The goal is to provide students with a robust theoretical foundation and an understanding of the mathematical tools needed to tackle complex algorithmic problems in their own research.
