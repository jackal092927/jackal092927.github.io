This is a graduate-level course on the design and analysis of algorithms, intended for PhD students. We will explore fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms for computationally challenging problems.

**Course Topics Include:**
- Divide and Conquer (Strassen's Algorithm, Closest Pair)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Sequence Alignment)
- NP and Intractability (Reductions, Cook-Levin Theorem)
- Approximation Algorithms (Set Cover, Vertex Cover, Max-Cut)
- Randomized Algorithms (Hashing, LSH, Bloom Filters, Karger's Min-Cut)
- Spectral Graph Theory (Graph Laplacian, Spectral Clustering)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma)

**Evaluation:**
- Homework Assignments (50%): 3-4 problem sets throughout the semester
- Final Project (50%): Research-oriented project with proposal, presentation, and final report
