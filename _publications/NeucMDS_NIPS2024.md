## Abstract

We introduce **N**on-**Euc**lidean-**MDS** (Neuc-MDS), an extension of classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) that accommodates non-Euclidean and non-metric inputs. The key idea is to generalize the standard inner product to symmetric bilinear forms so negative eigenvalues of dissimilarity Gram matrices can be used productively. Neuc-MDS efficiently chooses both positive and negative eigenvalues to reduce STRESS, the sum of squared pairwise error. We provide error analysis, proofs of optimality for minimizing lower bounds of STRESS, and evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets against linear and non-linear dimension reduction methods.
