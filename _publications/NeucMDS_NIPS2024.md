# Abstract
We introduce **N**on-**Euc**lidean-**MDS** (Neuc-MDS), an extension of classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) that accommodates non-Euclidean and non-metric inputs. The main idea is to generalize the standard inner product to symmetric bilinear forms to utilize the negative eigenvalues of dissimilarity Gram matrices. Neuc-MDS efficiently optimizes the choice of (both positive and negative) eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix to reduce STRESS, the sum of squared pairwise error. We provide an in-depth error analysis and proofs of the optimality in minimizing lower bounds of STRESS. We demonstrate Neuc-MDS's ability to address limitations of classical MDS raised by prior research, and test it on various synthetic and real-world datasets in comparison with both linear and non-linear dimension reduction methods.
