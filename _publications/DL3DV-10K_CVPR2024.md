## Abstract

We have witnessed significant progress in deep learning-based 3D vision, ranging from neural radiance field (NeRF) based 3D representation learning to applications in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, existing scene-level datasets—limited to either synthetic environments or a narrow selection of real-world scenes—are insufficient. This gap hinders comprehensive benchmarking and caps what could be explored in 3D analysis. To address this, we present DL3DV-10K, a large-scale scene dataset featuring 51.2 million frames from 10,510 videos captured across 65 types of points of interest, covering bounded and unbounded scenes with diverse reflection, transparency, and lighting. We benchmark recent NVS methods on DL3DV-10K and report insights for future research, including a pilot study on generalizable NeRF that underscores the need for large-scale scene-level data.
