# Abstract
We consider a cooperative learning scenario where a collection of networked agents with indi-
vidually owned classifiers dynamically update their predictions, for the same classification task,
through communication or observations of each otherâ€™s predictions. Clearly if highly influential
vertices use erroneous classifiers, there will be a negative effect on the accuracy of all the agents
in the network. We ask the following question: how can we optimally fix the prediction of a few
classifiers so as maximize the overall accuracy in the entire network. To this end we consider an
aggregate and an egalitarian objective function. We show a polynomial time algorithm for optimiz-
ing the aggregate objective function, and show that optimizing the egalitarian objective function
is NP-hard. Furthermore, we develop approximation algorithms for the egalitarian improvement.
The performance of all of our algorithms are guaranteed by mathematical analysis and backed by
experiments on synthetic and real data.
