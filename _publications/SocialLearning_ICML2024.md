## Abstract

We study cooperative learning where networked agents, each owning a classifier for the same task, update predictions via communication or observation. If influential vertices rely on erroneous classifiers, accuracy degrades for the whole network. We ask how to optimally fix a few classifiers to maximize overall accuracy. We propose aggregate and egalitarian objectives, give a polynomial-time algorithm for the aggregate objective, prove the egalitarian objective is NP-hard, and design approximation algorithms for that setting. Mathematical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real data validate the approach.

- Polynomial-time optimization for the aggregate objective
- NP-hardness and approximation algorithms for the egalitarian objective
- Empirical validation on synthetic and real datasets
